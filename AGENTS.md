# Models as a Service (MaaS)

Kubernetes-native platform for managing inference model endpoints, built with Go, controller-runtime, and Gateway API.

## Repository structure

Independent Go modules — **no root `go.mod` or root `Makefile`**. Always `cd` into the correct subproject before running Go tooling.

| Directory | What it is |
|-----------|-----------|
| `maas-controller/` | Kubernetes controller (kubebuilder, controller-runtime) |
| `maas-api/` | HTTP API service (keys, tokens, subscriptions) |
| `maas-discovery/` | Tenant discovery service (multi-tenancy, ADR ODH-ADR-MS-0004) |
| `deployment/` | Kustomize manifests (base, overlays, components) |
| `docs/` | MkDocs user/admin documentation |
| `test/e2e/` | pytest-based E2E tests |
| `scripts/` | Deploy and CI helper scripts |

## CRDs

API group: `maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`

Types in `maas-controller/api/maas/v1alpha1/`: **Tenant**, **MaaSModelRef**, **MaaSAuthPolicy**, **MaaSSubscription**, **ExternalModel**.

## Build and test commands

### maas-controller (from repo root)

```bash
make -C maas-controller generate manifests   # after changing api/ types or RBAC markers
make -C maas-controller verify-codegen       # verify generated code is in sync
make -C maas-controller lint                 # golangci-lint
make -C maas-controller test                 # unit tests with -race
```

### maas-api (from maas-api/)

```bash
make lint
make test
```

### maas-discovery (from maas-discovery/)

```bash
make lint
make test
make build    # full pipeline: tidy, lint, test, binary
```

### Kustomize manifests (from repo root)

```bash
./scripts/ci/validate-manifests.sh           # requires kustomize 5.7.x
```

## Codegen rule

If you change any file under `maas-controller/api/` or modify `//+kubebuilder:rbac:` markers anywhere in `maas-controller/`, you **must** run `make -C maas-controller generate manifests` and include the generated files in your commit. CI will reject PRs with stale generated code.

## RBAC changes: parent operator repos (required)

RBAC for maas-controller is also consumed by parent operators. Any change that affects ClusterRole/Role rules, bindings, or `//+kubebuilder:rbac:` markers (including regenerated `deployment/base/maas-controller/rbac/` manifests) **must** be mirrored in both:

- https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-gateway-operator/
- https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator

### Before opening a PR in this repo

If the developer asks an agent to create a PR and the branch includes RBAC changes:

1. **Stop and remind them** that companion PRs are required in both parent repos above.
2. Ask whether those PRs already exist (or whether the agent should help prepare them).
3. Do **not** open this repo's PR until the developer confirms how to proceed.

### This repo's PR body

- When companion PRs exist, link both URLs in the PR description (e.g. under a **Parent operator PRs** section).
- When companion PRs **cannot** be created yet, put this notice at the **very top** of the PR body (above Summary):

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Parent operator RBAC not yet updated.** This PR changes maas-controller RBAC.
> Companion PRs are still needed in:
> - https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-gateway-operator/
> - https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator
> Do not merge until those repos reflect the same RBAC changes (link the PRs here when ready).
```

## Kustomize / deployment

- `deployment/base/maas-controller/default` — operator bootstrap (CRDs, RBAC, Deployment, default CRs such as `Config`). `./scripts/deploy.sh` applies `deployment/base/maas-controller/crd` first and waits **Established**, then applies this bundle unchanged (avoids CRD/CR ordering issues on install).
- `maas-api/deploy/overlays/odh` — tenant overlay rendered at runtime inside the controller container
- `deployment/base/maas-controller/default/params.env` — build-time defaults; runtime values come from ODH's environment variables
- The controller image embeds `maas-api/deploy`, `deployment/base/maas-api`, components, and policies via Dockerfile COPY

When editing Kustomize files, always run `./scripts/ci/validate-manifests.sh` before committing.

## PR titles

Semantic format required: `type: subject` (lowercase subject).

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

## PR review process

After creating a PR, immediately add a comment with `@coderabbitai review` to trigger automated code review.

If the PR includes RBAC changes, follow **RBAC changes: parent operator repos** above: remind the developer before creating the PR, link companion parent-operator PRs when available, or put the `[!IMPORTANT]` notice at the top of the PR body if those PRs do not exist yet.

## PR description: risk analysis

When you open or draft a pull request, include a **Risk analysis** in the PR body:

- **Risk rating**: an integer from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
- **Why**: a short explanation of how you chose the rating (what could break, what is untested, or why it is safe).

Use this scale consistently:

| Rating | Typical meaning |
|--------|-----------------|
| 0 | Documentation-only or other changes with negligible runtime impact (e.g. typo fixes, clarifications under `docs/` that do not change product behavior). |
| 1–3 | Any change to code (Go, scripts that affect builds/deploys, Kustomize, CI logic, etc.) is at least 1. Most code changes fall in 2–3 depending on scope, blast radius, and how well unit/integration tests cover the path. |
| 4–5 | Automatically 4 or 5 if the behavior is unlikely to be covered by the Prow smoke path in `test/e2e/scripts/prow_run_smoke_test.sh` (review that script's steps and env flags — e.g. full deploy, API keys, subscriptions, models endpoints, deployment validation; paths gated by variables may not run in default CI). |
| 4–5 | Automatically 4 or 5 for changes involving external systems or tight coupling to upstream operators (e.g. OpenDataHub / parent operator integration, operator catalog images, or contracts outside this repo). |

If multiple rules apply, use the **highest** justified rating and explain the main drivers in **Why**.

## Testing conventions

- Go tests use `testing` + `gomega` or `testify` — match the style of the package you're editing.
- E2E tests are pytest under `test/e2e/tests/`.
- New functionality must include tests.

## Documentation policy

- **Search before writing.** Before creating or updating any doc, search `docs/content/` and existing markdown files for overlapping content. If the topic is already covered, update that file — do not create a new one.
- **One source of truth.** Never duplicate information across files. Link to the canonical location instead of repeating content.
- **Update, don't duplicate.** If a feature changes behavior already documented somewhere, find and update that section in place.
- **No shadow docs.** Do not create parallel docs (e.g., a new `docs/content/foo.md` when `docs/content/advanced-administration/foo.md` already exists, or a root-level `*.md` that restates what's in `docs/`).

## Things to never do

- Do not create a root-level `go.mod` or `Makefile`.
- Do not guess image tags, registry paths, or namespace names — ask or check `params.env` and `params.go`.
- Do not edit `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` or CRD YAML by hand — always regenerate.
- Do not create a new doc file without first confirming no existing file covers the same topic.
