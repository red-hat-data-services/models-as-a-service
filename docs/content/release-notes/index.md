## Unreleased (RHOAI 3.6)

**Release Date:** TBD

### Upgrade notes

See [Upgrade to 3.6](../migration/upgrade-to-3.6.md) for full guidance. Summary:

- **Recommended short downtime** when upgrading from 3.5 → 3.6 while AuthPolicy / TRLP / maas-api adopt short subscription rate-limit IDs (avoids a brief rate-limit fail-open window).
- **Token rate-limit counters reset** on upgrade (limit keys become rate-grouped `tokens-*`, counters use `selected_subscription_id`). Limitador enforcement budgets start fresh for the current window.
- **Prometheus and Loki usage history are unaffected** — telemetry still labels by subscription name (`selected_subscription` / `X-MaaS-Subscription`), not the rate-limit ID.

### Key Fixes

- **Short subscription rate-limit IDs in TokenRateLimitPolicy:** TRLP `when` predicates and counters use a stable 16-hex SHA-256 of `namespace/name@modelNs/model` (`selected_subscription_id`) so Kuadrant WASM / EnvoyFilter size no longer embeds long subscription strings. Limit map keys stay rate-grouped (`tokens-<limit>-per-<window>`). Human-readable `selected_subscription_key` remains for telemetry.

---

## v0.2.1

**Release Date:** TBD

### Breaking Changes

**`X-MaaS-Tenant` header eliminated (RHOAIENG-70517)**
- The `X-MaaS-Tenant` header is no longer sent or expected. Tenant identity is now derived from the `AITenant` CR and namespace context. Clients and middleware that depend on this header must be updated.

**AITenant automatic RBAC bindings removed**
- `AITenant.spec.rbac` is deprecated and ignored. Existing manifests that still include the field remain schema-valid, but the controller no longer creates RoleBindings from it. The controller still creates tenant-admin Roles; platform administrators must create standard Kubernetes RoleBindings to grant access. See [Tenant RBAC](../configuration-and-management/tenant-rbac.md).

**Tenant configuration migrated to MaasTenantConfig**
- MaaS runtime settings (`apiKeys`, `telemetry`) previously in the legacy `Tenant` CR are now managed via the namespace-scoped `MaasTenantConfig` CR. OIDC and gateway context moved to the owning `AITenant`. Existing `Tenant.spec` fields are copied to `MaasTenantConfig/default-tenant` automatically during the migration grace window.

**Infrastructure namespace separation**
- MaaS infrastructure resources (secrets, config) now reside in a dedicated infrastructure namespace rather than the controller namespace. Existing deployments are migrated automatically.

### New Features

**Body-based routing (BBR)**

- Models can now be selected via the `model` field in the request body (OpenAI-compatible format) in addition to URL path routing. Enables standard OpenAI SDK compatibility without path manipulation.
- Canonical BBR model ID surfaced in `GET /v1/models` and `MaaSModelRef.status`.
- Model-provider-resolver and maas-headers-guard added to the IPP pipeline for BBR support.

**Multi-tenancy enhancements**

- Default `AITenant` bootstrapped automatically for single-tenant deployments.
- Any MaaS tenant can now be removed (not just non-default tenants).
- Validating webhook prevents multiple `AITenant` CRs from claiming the same namespace.
- Per-tenant IPP (Inference Payload Processing) stacks deployed for each `AITenant` gateway.
- Configurable `AITenant` deletion timeout with force-remove finalizer.
- `GET /v1/tenants` endpoint for gateway discovery.

**Observability**

- OTel Collector deployment for usage log collection.
- EnvoyFilter for OTel structured usage logging with model and tenant context.
- Logs-based usage dashboards and tenant-specific dashboard panels.
- Tenant-level metrics, tracing, and logging.
- Perses dashboards deployed via `maas-controller`.

**Controller self-teardown**

- `maas-controller` supports clean uninstallation — removes managed resources while preserving tenant namespaces.

**Non-OpenShift Kubernetes (xKS) support**

- New `xKS` overlay enables MaaS deployment on vanilla Kubernetes clusters.
- OpenShift-only watchers are skipped on xKS to prevent cache-sync timeouts.

**Security hardening**

- Container hardening: `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `seccompProfile` (FIND-007).
- Request body size limit to prevent OOM (FIND-011).
- Startup fails on missing gateway host; non-HTTPS probe URLs rejected (FIND-010).
- Debug CORS restricted to `http://localhost` only (FIND-Debug-CORS).
- Database credentials removed from error messages (FIND-006).
- `X-MaaS-Username` and `X-MaaS-Group` added to sensitive headers (FIND-014).
- SA token automount disabled on cleanup CronJob (FIND-015).
- `X-MaaS-Subscription` header ignored for non-API-key requests (FIND-009).
- Username hashed/redacted in logs.
- GitHub Actions pinned to immutable commit SHAs.
- `govulncheck` added for maas-api and maas-controller.

**Bulk API key revocation enhancements**

- Subscription-scoped bulk revoke: administrators can revoke all API keys bound to a specific `MaaSSubscription` in a single call.
- Combined scope: revoke keys for a specific user within a specific subscription.
- Dry-run mode (`dryRun: true`): preview how many keys would be revoked without mutating any data.
- Structured audit records emitted for every actual bulk revoke operation (action, actor, scope, count, tenant).
- See [API Key Administration](../configuration-and-management/api-key-administration.md) for usage examples.

**Additional features**

- OpenShift cluster TLS profiles honored for gateway and controller TLS configuration.
- OIDC JWKS cache TTL configurable via `Tenant` CR and wired to Authorino.
- `maas-api` and `payload-processing` replica count configurable via `Tenant` annotation.
- API key display name exposed in auth identity.
- Unauthorized models filtered from `GET /subscriptions` response.
- `stream_options.include_usage` enforced in IPP pipeline.
- KServe upgraded to v0.19.0 with model-based routing support.
- New AI Gateway base manifest entry point for modularized deployment.
- Configurable Limitador scrape interval.
- API key update debouncing.

**Model access authorization externalized**

- Model access checks moved from inline allowlists in the gateway AuthPolicy to `accessAllowed` metadata returned by maas-api during subscription selection. The gateway authorization rule is now fixed-size regardless of how many subscriptions or models exist, removing a scaling limit caused by per-model allowlists growing the AuthPolicy CR.

### Key Fixes

- **Gateway wasm config exceeding the etcd size limit (RHOAIENG-95277):** each model's `TokenRateLimitPolicy` now has one limit per distinct rate set instead of one per subscription. A subscription at an existing rate adds a predicate clause (about 3 KB per listener) to the gateway's `kuadrant-{gateway-name}` EnvoyFilter (WasmPlugin on Kuadrant 1.4.x) instead of a whole limit (about 27 KB). Budgets stay separate per subscription and per user. See [Subscription Cardinality](../advanced-administration/subscription-cardinality.md#gateway-config-size).
    - **Upgrade note:** limit names change from `{namespace}-{subscription}-{model}-tokens` to `tokens-{limit}-per-{window}`, so Limitador starts fresh counters once on upgrade (and again on rollback). With long windows (for example `24h`), users can spend up to twice their budget in the window that spans the change.
- **CVE-2026-33815 / CVE-2026-33816:** pgx memory-safety and SQL injection fixes.
- Prevent crash-loop when Kuadrant or KServe CRDs are not installed.
- Preserve MaaS traffic during RHOAI 3.5 upgrades.
- Require both `Accepted` and `Enforced` conditions for gateway `AuthPolicy` readiness.
- Scope gateway `deny-all` auth to model inference paths only; exempt `/v1/subscriptions` and `/v1/api-keys`.
- Resolve body-routed model names in gateway `AuthPolicy` and subscription validation.
- Gracefully handle empty `monitoring-namespace` configuration.
- Scope Secret informer cache to infrastructure namespace.
- Parse Authorino bracket-wrapped groups header format.
- Return empty list (not error) from management endpoints when no auth context present.
- **Gateway auth 401/403 responses now return OpenAI-compatible JSON error bodies (RHOAIENG-94567):** Previously, the gateway `AuthPolicy` returned empty or plain-text bodies for authentication and authorization failures. Responses now include structured `{"error":{"message":"...","type":"...","code":...}}` JSON bodies with `Content-Type: application/json`, matching the OpenAI error format expected by standard SDKs and clients.

### Known Limitations

- **Token rate limits for non-OpenAI API formats:** Token-based rate limiting counts tokens only for OpenAI-compatible request/response formats. Models using other API formats (e.g., Anthropic Messages API) are not metered. See [Token Rate Limiting](../configuration-and-management/quota-and-access-configuration.md).
- **External models in multi-tenant deployments:** External models are not yet fully supported in multi-tenant configurations. See [External Model Setup](../install/external-model-setup.md).

## v0.2.0

**Release Date:** TBD

### Breaking Changes

**Gateway-level AuthPolicy (RHOAIENG-62571)**
- The `maas-controller` now creates a single `AuthPolicy/maas-gateway-auth` in the gateway namespace (`openshift-ingress`) instead of one per-model `AuthPolicy` in each model namespace.
- Per-model `AuthPolicy` objects managed by the controller are deleted on the first reconcile after upgrade.
- `status.authPolicies` now references `maas-gateway-auth / openshift-ingress` instead of per-model policy names.
- New admission webhooks (`failurePolicy=Ignore`) validate that `MaaSAuthPolicy` and `MaaSSubscription` are created in namespaces that contain a `MaasTenantConfig` CR.
- `AITenant` created outside the configured `--aitenant-namespace` are now rejected at admission instead of being accepted and later marked `Failed/InvalidPlacement` by the controller.
- **Minimum Kuadrant version:** v1.4.2 or later required for `spec.defaults.rules` support.
- **End-user auth behavior is unchanged** — valid API key + active subscription + allowed group still returns `200`.

### New Features

**Singleton gateway AuthPolicy**
- All per-model allowlists aggregated into one CEL expression in `maas-gateway-auth`
- Dynamic model identity extracted from `X-Gateway-Model-Name` header with `request.path` fallback
- Model-aware cache keys prevent subscription result pollution across models
- Response header injection: `X-MaaS-Subscription`, `userId`, `username`, `groups`

**Admission webhooks**
- Validating webhooks for `MaaSAuthPolicy` and `MaaSSubscription` enforce namespace tenancy requirements

## v0.1.1

**Release Date:** 2026-05-01

### Breaking Changes

**Required `spec` field for MaaS CRs**
- `MaaSAuthPolicy`, `MaaSSubscription`, and `MaaSModelRef` now require the `spec` field
- CRs without `spec` are marked as `Invalid` and new CRs without `spec` are blocked
- Tenant.Spec remains optional
- **Migration:** Add a `spec` field to existing `MaaSAuthPolicy`, `MaaSSubscription`, and `MaaSModelRef` CRs that lack one (e.g., add `spec: {}` if needed)

### New Features

**MaasTenantConfig CR**
- MaaS runtime configuration centralized in the `MaasTenantConfig` CR (`maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`)
- Auto-bootstrapped as `default-tenant` in `models-as-a-service` namespace
- Configurable API key lifetime and telemetry via `spec` fields
- See [MaasTenantConfig CR Configuration](../install/maas-setup.md#maastenantconfig-cr)

**Observability**
- Perses dashboards for model usage visualization
- Admin usage dashboard for token consumption tracking
- ServiceMonitor for maas-controller metrics

**OIDC Enhancements**
- OIDC token support for `/v1/models` endpoint
- Configurable cluster audience via `--cluster-audience` flag

**External Models**
- External models (introduced in v0.1.0) now included in `/v1/models` listings
- Namespace prefix added to HTTPRoute paths for LLMInferenceService parity

### Key Improvements

- Fail-close logic when Limitador is unavailable prevents rate limit bypass
- Degraded/failed subscriptions rejected at auth layer
- Token rate limit validation aligned with Kuadrant TokenRateLimitPolicy windows
- Terminating namespace handling during RHOAI upgrades
- Local Kind deployment support for development

### Known Limitations

- **Shared HTTPRoute token rate limits:** Multiple `MaaSModelRef` resources on the same `HTTPRoute` create multiple `TokenRateLimitPolicy` objects, but only one may be enforced at the gateway. See [Quota and Access Configuration](../configuration-and-management/quota-and-access-configuration.md) for workarounds.
